# ROS 2 Concepts

The Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2) is a flexible framework for writing robot software. It is a collection of tools, libraries, and conventions that aim to simplify the task of creating complex and robust robot behavior across a wide variety of robotic platforms. Understanding its core concepts is fundamental to developing applications for physical AI humanoids.

## Key ROS 2 Concepts

1.  **Nodes:**
    *   **Definition:** A node is an executable that uses ROS 2 to communicate with other nodes. It's a fundamental building block of a ROS 2 system, responsible for a single modular purpose (e.g., controlling a motor, reading a sensor, performing a navigation task).
    *   **Example:** A camera driver node, a motor control node, a localization node.

2.  **Topics:**
    *   **Definition:** Topics are the primary mechanism for asynchronous, one-to-many, publish-subscribe communication in ROS 2. Nodes publish messages to topics, and other nodes subscribe to those topics to receive the messages.
    *   **Characteristics:**
        *   **Loose Coupling:** Publishers and subscribers don't need to know about each other's existence.
        *   **Data Streaming:** Ideal for continuous data flows like sensor readings (e.g., camera images, lidar scans).
    *   **Example:** A camera node publishes images on `/image_raw` topic; a computer vision node subscribes to `/image_raw` to process images.

3.  **Messages:**
    *   **Definition:** Data structures used for communication over topics, services, and actions. Each message has a predefined type (e.g., `sensor_msgs/msg/Image`, `std_msgs/msg/String`).
    *   **Custom Messages:** Users can define their own message types to suit specific application needs.

4.  **Services:**
    *   **Definition:** Services provide synchronous, request-response communication between nodes. A client node sends a request, and a service-providing node processes it and returns a response.
    *   **Characteristics:**
        *   **Guaranteed Delivery:** The client waits for a response.
        *   **Single Request/Response:** Ideal for tasks that require a specific action and a result (e.g., "turn on the gripper," "get map data").
    *   **Example:** A navigation client requests a path to a goal from a navigation service.

5.  **Actions:**
    *   **Definition:** Actions provide a long-running, asynchronous, goal-feedback-result communication mechanism. They are built on topics and services and are designed for tasks that might take a long time to complete and where progress updates are desired.
    *   **Characteristics:**
        *   **Goal:** The initial request sent by the client.
        *   **Feedback:** Continuous updates on the progress of the action.
        *   **Result:** The final outcome of the action.
    *   **Example:** A robot arm action client sends a goal to move to a specific pose; the action server provides feedback on current joint positions and a final result (success/failure).

6.  **Parameters:**
    *   **Definition:** Parameters are dynamic values that can be configured for nodes at runtime. They allow for easy adjustment of node behavior without recompiling the code.
    *   **Example:** Setting the PID gains for a motor controller, defining a threshold for object detection.

7.  **ROS 2 Graph:**
    *   **Definition:** The entire network of ROS 2 nodes and their connections (topics, services, actions, parameters). Visualizing the graph helps in understanding the data flow and communication patterns within a robotic system.

## Tooling

ROS 2 comes with a rich set of command-line tools to interact with and debug the system:

*   `ros2 run`: Runs an executable from a package.
*   `ros2 topic`: Inspects topic communication (e.g., `ros2 topic list`, `ros2 topic echo`).
*   `ros2 service`: Inspects service communication (e.g., `ros2 service list`, `ros2 service call`).
*   `ros2 node`: Inspects node information (e.g., `ros2 node list`, `ros2 node info`).
*   `ros2 param`: Inspects and sets parameters.
*   `rviz2`: A 3D visualization tool for robot data.
*   `rqt_graph`: A graphical tool to visualize the ROS 2 computational graph.

By mastering these core concepts and tools, you will be well-equipped to develop sophisticated robotic applications using ROS 2.
